        <td><li>Js is a client-side scripting language that execute on your broweser.<br></li>
            <li>Js essentially used to make your pages alive</li>
            <li>Using Js we can capture event, create animations, validating user inputs and much more.</li>
            <li>In present Js not only execute on browser but also on the server.</li>
            <li>Node.js is one of the most amazing example of server-side JavaScript</li>

<h3>History of JavaScipt</h3>
   <li>Js was developed by Brendan Eich in Netscape Communications Corporation in 1995</li>
   <li>JavaScript started his life with the name Mocha ans was concisely named LiveScript.</li>
    <li>In 1995 LiveScript officially renamed to JavaScript with Netscape Navigator Road leads</li>
    

<h3>What is ECMAScript</h3>
   <li>ECMA stands for Europian Computer Manufacturers Association, a private international nonprofit standard organization.</li>
   <li>In 1996 Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA.</li>
   <li>JavaScript is implementation of ECMAScript.</li>
   

<h3>What is ES6</h3>
   <li>ECMAScript 6 is update of ES5 which was standardize in 2009.</li>
   <li>ES6 was published by ECMA International in June 2015.</li>

<h3>Literals, Variables & Constants</h3>
<table style="border: none  padding: 10px;">
    <tr>
        <td>Variables</td>
        <td><li>Variable is a name that contains a specific value</li></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Constant</td>
        <td><li>In ES6 a new Keyword added in the JavaScript which is const.</li>
        <li>Constant also hold value but unlike variables it can't be changed after initialization.</li>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Identifier</td>
        <td><li>Variables and constants are usually call identifier.</li>
        <li>Identifier consists of letters numbers Underscore(_) and the Dollar ($) sign.</li>
        <li>Unicode Characters are allowed</li>
        <li>Identifier must start with the letter Dollar sign ($) or underscore(_).</li>
        <li>Identifier cannot be a reserved word.(words that created for a specific task).</li>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Literals</td>
        <td><li>You are providing a value directly in the program.</li>
        <li>Literals is just the way to create identifier with the value.</li>
    </tr>

<h3>Primitive Type & Object</h3>
<h4>Primitive Types</h4>
<p>JavaScript Data or values are primitive or object. Primitive data are immutable means we cannot change the value of the variable after initializing<br>JS recognized four types of numerical literals, Binary, Decimal, Octal, HexaDecimal.</p>

<h4>Boolean</h4> 
<p> Boolean is just a value type that have only two possible values. True or False. We dont use boolean values inside quotaion marks.("")</p>

<h4>Symbols</h4> 
<p>In ecmascript 6 we have a new type symbol.<br>Symbols is the new data type in es6 which represent Unique tokens.<br>Once you created a symbol it is unique and it will not match any other symbols.</p>

<h4>Null & Undefined</h4> 
<p>JS has two special types null and undefined.<br>Null has only one possible value which is Null and undefined has only one possible value undefined<br>Both Null and undefined Represent something doesn't exist.</p>

<h4>Object Types</h4>
<li>Array</li>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Regular Expression</li>
<li>Map & WeakMap</li>
<li>Set and WeakSet</li>

<h4>What is Object?</h4>
<li>Objects are mutable</li>
<li>Can change any value anytime.</li>
<li>Object is just like a Container that can have different kind of data.</li>
<li>Object literal syntax :{} </li>

<h4>Array</h4>
<li>Array is Collection of Different types of Data.</li>
<li>Array Start with [0] and end with [n] value.</li>
<li>Array element can be any type of of data, It may be objects or primitive type.</li>
<li>Array size is not fixed so you can add and remove array element anytime.</li>
<li>Array is zero based. So the first element of the array is 0 next element is 1 and so on.</li>

<h4>Date</h4>
<li>Represent date and time using date object.</li>

<h4>Date</h4>
<li>Represent date and time using date object.</li>

<h4>Regular Expression</h4>
<li>It is a sub language of JavaScript</li>
<li>Used to perform Complex search and replace operations on strings.</li>


<h4>Maps and Sets</h4>
<li>In new ECMAScript 6 a new data type introduced is map and set and their week counterpart, WeekMap and Weakset.</li>
<li>Maps are just likean object but it offers more advantages than object in certain situations</li>
<li>Set are similar to array expect they can't content duplicate element.</li>
